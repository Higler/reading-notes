forms are a fundamental component of web development, serving as a bridge between users and websites, enabling data collection and interaction, and supporting critical functionality across a wide range of online applications

thing to keep in mind designing forms is Clear and Concise Labels, Proper Field Order, Grouping Related Fields, Placeholder Text, Required Fields, and Error Handling

five form elements are Text Input Fields: Text input fields are used for users to enter text-based information, such as names, email addresses, or comments. Radio Buttons and Checkboxes: Radio buttons and checkboxes allow users to make selections from predefined options. Select Menus (Dropdowns): Select menus, also known as dropdowns, present a list of options in a space-saving format. Text Areas: Text areas are larger input fields that allow users to enter longer text, such as comments, reviews, or feedback. Submit Buttons: Submit buttons are used to confirm the user's input and send the form data to the server for processing. 

Events are like actions or occurrences that happen in various situations, just like things happening in the real world. Imagine you're at a party, and there are different activities going on. When someone starts singing, that's an event. When people start dancing, that's another event. Events are moments or actions that we can notice, respond to, or be a part of.

When using the addEventListener() method you will need to provide Event Type and Event Listener 

The event object is a fundamental concept in web development and is automatically created and passed to event handler functions when an event occurs in the browser. It contains information about the event, such as the type of event, the target element, and additional data related to the event. The event object allows developers to access and manipulate information related to the event that triggered the event handler.

the main difference between event bubbling and event capturing is the order in which the event handlers are executed, with bubbling moving from the innermost element to the outermost, and capturing moving from the outermost to the innermost. Event bubbling is more commonly used, while event capturing is often employed in specific situations where capturing the event at a higher level in the DOM is necessary.
