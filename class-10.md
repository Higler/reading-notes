syntax errors occur when there are violations of the programming language's syntax rules. These errors typically prevent the code from being executed because the code structure is incorrect. Logic errors, also known as semantic errors, occur when the code is syntactically correct but does not produce the desired or expected results. They are errors in the logical flow or algorithm of the program.

my most common errors are definitely syntax errors most commonly directory errors, curly brace erros, or semicolon erros. These all seem very simple but I often am moving faster in my brain than my fingers and think i do stuff that my fingers dont read things too fast and dont fully process them and it leads to simple errors that i over look becasue I'm usually ina hurry and forget to go back and check the small stuff. These are mostly corrected by having others put a second set of eyes on my work in the occasion I dont catch it myself. 

this will always influence my long term goals because I plan on writing code in some shape or form every day for the rest of my life and errors, especially small easily preventable ones should be avoided when possible. I need to become better at slowing down and focusing on the small things to become a better developer over all. 

JavaScript Debugger is a powerful tool that helps software developers inspect, analyze, and debug their JavaScript code. It allows you to pause the execution of your code at specific points, inspect variables, and step through your code line by line to find and fix issues

A breakpoint is a marker or point in your source code that you set when using a debugger in software development. It instructs the debugger to pause or stop the execution of your program at that specific location

call stack is a data structure used in computer programming to manage the flow of function calls and their respective execution contexts in a program. It keeps track of the order in which functions are called and their relationships, allowing the program to know where to return after a function call is completed.
