An object is like a digital toy box,  you use it to store and organize digital things like you did your toys as a child. 

Using object literals to define objects has several advantages such as simplicity, readability, organization, and flexibility.

objects are for organizing data as key-value pairs when the order doesn't matter, and you want to access data by name. Arrays are designed for ordered collections of elements when you need to maintain a specific sequence and access elements by their position. 

You would need to use bracket notation to access an object's property instead of dot notation when the property name contains special characters, spaces, or starts with a number. If the property name is not a valid javascript identifier you cannot use dot notation, bracket notation allows you to access such properties.

the term "this" refers to the object dog itself, the "this" keyword, in the context of the humanAge function, refers to the object that the function is a part of, which is dog in this case. The advantage of using "this" in this context is that it allows you to access and work with the object's properties and methods within the object itself.

the DOM is a representation of the structure and content of a web page as a tree of objects, and javascript provides a way to interact with and manipulate this tree of objects to create dynamic and interactive web applications.

 Document Object Model is a programming interface for web documents, it represents the structure of an html or xml document as a tree-like structure of objects. In javascript, the dom is a way to interact with web pages and their content, allowing you to manipulate and update the content, structure, and style of a web page dynamically.

summary: objects are a vital part of javascript and organizing them and accessing them properly is major part of development, using different method such as DOM to help with this is vital in a developers career
