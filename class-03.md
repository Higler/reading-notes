Once upon a time in a land known as the World of Web, there lived two characters with distinct personalities: Margin and Padding. They played pivotal roles in a story titled "The Box Model."

Margin, a character with a reserved and standoffish demeanor, was always keen on maintaining his personal space. He loved to create a buffer zone around himself to ensure that he wasn't too close to anyone or anything. In the World of Web, Margin's role was quite similar. He provided the outermost layer of an element, creating space between it and other elements on the page. His main purpose was to establish a separation between an element and its surroundings, much like building a fortress wall to protect a castle from the outside world.

On the other hand, there was Padding, a warm and welcoming character who loved to make people feel comfortable. Padding's role in the story was to provide inner comfort to an element, like a soft cushion in a cozy chair. He made sure the content within an element was cushioned from the borders, creating a sense of inner space and comfort.
